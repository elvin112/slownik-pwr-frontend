Fix the sidebar title refresh bug (it doesn't refresh in new title or title deletion) with redux

3- create a users page where you list their posts, make usernames link for that page

4- make home page show some posts from the first page


Bugs:
I tried to make update prettier with selection of all the text when update button is clicked but couldn't make it 
Maybe we can work on it later
